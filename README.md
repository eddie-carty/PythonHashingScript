<h1>Python Hashing Script</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of a simple Python script that calculates and compares file hashes (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256) to verify file integrity and detect alterations.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Visual Studio Code</b>
- <b>MD5 Hashing Algorithm</b>
- <b>SHA1 Hashing Algorithm</b>
- <b>SHA256 Hashing Algorithm</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>MacOS</b> 

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
First we write our python script, I have used Visual Studio Code and saved the script locally on my computer: <br/>

<br />
Then we need to make a test file for hashing, a simple text file will do:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next we can upload it to an online hashing service to get a known good hash value to compare against: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next I opened terminal, navigated to the saved script, ran it and selected my test file. It worked as intended and we now have our hash to compare:  <br/>
